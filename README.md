This is a repository that I have created for Acumen (IITG Quiz Club).
The main aim of this repo is to create and mentain a website for Acumen.
I will give basic layout of the website below.

The homepage is called index.html.
                  In index.html there is Acumen's logo which on clicking redirects to itself.
                     Then there are three sections caled Past, Ongoing & Upcoming. On clicking the images they will redirect you to past-events.html, ongoing.html & upcoming.html respectively.
                     Further down in index.html, there's button for QGP Leaderboard that will have to be updated manually.
                     Below there's an About Us section that tells about Quiz Club, IITG. Also there's a Meet the Team for introduction to team members.
                     Under About Us section, there are links to reach out to Acumen directly.
                     Below that there are Resources and Weekly Sets Button that lead to respective links.

  In past-events.html, there's posters of all the quizzes conducted by Acumen post-2021.
  In ongoing.html, there's information about the ongoing event i.e. Quizzing Grand Prix(QGP).
  In upcoming.html, there are posters of upcoming quizzes.
